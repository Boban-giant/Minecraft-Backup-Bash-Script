A simple script to manage minecraft servers. It handles restarts of the server to fully backup the game world.

The script is fully functional but needs some code polish. Please refer to the comments in the script for configuration.

TODO:
Add parameter support to enable simple managing of multiple servers, no need to edit script.
Tidy up code and checks.
